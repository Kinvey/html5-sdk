# Kinvey HTML5 SDK [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Kinvey/html5-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Kinvey/html5-sdk) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/Kinvey/html5-sdk/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Kinvey/html5-sdk)

[Kinvey](http://www.kinvey.com) (pronounced Kin-vey, like convey) makes it ridiculously easy for developers to setup, use and operate a cloud backend for their mobile apps. They don't have to worry about connecting to various cloud services, setting up servers for their backend, or maintaining and scaling them.

This npm package makes it very easy to connect your HTML5 app with Kinvey.

## How to use

### 1. Sign up for Kinvey
To use the SDK, sign up for Kinvey if you have not already done so. Go to the [sign up](https://console.kinvey.com/#signup) page, and follow the steps provided.

### 2. Install the SDK
You can install the module using npm:

```bash
npm install kinvey-html5-sdk --save
```

or

use our [DevCenter Download Page](http://devcenter.kinvey.com/html5/downloads) to download the SDK and save it to a file name `kinvey-html5-sdk.js` in your project.

### 3. Configure the SDK
If you installed the SDK with npm, include the sdk in your code using `require`.

```javascript
var Kinvey = require('kinvey-html5-sdk');
```

If you downloaded the SDK and saved it to a file, add a script tag to your main html file to load the SDK.

```html
<script src="path/to/kinvey-html5-sdk.js"></script>
```

Next, use `Kinvey.initialize` to configure your app. Replace `<appKey>` and `<appSecret>` with your apps app key and secret. You can find these for your app using the [Kinvey Console App](https://console.kinvey.com).

```javascript
Kinvey.initialize({
    appKey: '<appKey>',
    appSecret: '<appSecret>'
})
  .then(function(activeUser) {
    // ...
  });
```
