# Kinvey
[Kinvey](http://www.kinvey.com) (pronounced Kin-vey, like convey) makes it ridiculously easy for developers to setup, use and operate a cloud backend for their mobile apps. They don't have to worry about connecting to various cloud services, setting up servers for their backend, or maintaining and scaling them.

This node and bower module makes it very easy to connect your HTML5 app with Kinvey.

## How to use

### 1. Sign up for Kinvey
To use the library, sign up for Kinvey if you have not already done so. Go to the [sign up](https://console.kinvey.com/#signup) page, and follow the steps provided.

### 2. Install the library
You can install the module using npm:

```bash
npm install kinvey-html5 --save
```

or

```bash
bower install kinvey-html5 --save
```

### 3. Configure the library
Now, the library is available for use in your project.

If you installed the library with npm, import the library in your code using `require`.

```javascript
var Kinvey = require('kinvey-html5');
```

If you installed the library with bower, add a script tag to your main html file.

```html
<script src="bower_components/kinvey-html5/dist/kinvey.min.js"></script>
```

Next, use `Kinvey.init` to configure your app:

```javascript
Kinvey.init({
    appKey: '<appKey>',
    appSecret: '<appSecret>'
});
```


### 4. Verify Set Up
You can use the following snippet to verify the app credentials were entered correctly. This function will contact the backend and verify that the library can communicate with your app.

```javascript
Kinvey.ping().then(function(response) {
  console.log('Kinvey Ping Success. Kinvey Service is alive, version: ' + response.version + ', response: ' + response.kinvey);
}).catch(function(error) {
  console.log('Kinvey Ping Failed. Response: ' + error.description);
});
```
