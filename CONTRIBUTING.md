### Reporting Issues

We recommend the following guidelines for reporting bugs -

- For faster response, we recommend using [Kinvey support](https://support.kinvey.com/support/home).
- For bugs and enhancements specific to the JS library that are not time critical, developers may [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Kinvey/html5-sdk/issues).

### Contributing Code

When contributing to the repository, please follow these guidelines -

- All contributions must be in the form of a pull request, with the `master` branch as the base.
- Pull requests must pass the unit tests in the codebase. Whenever possible, new code should also add unit tests.
- Each commit should include a commit message describing the change; and each pull request should include a high level summary of the bug or enhancement being addressed by the pull request.
- The core team (Kinvey engineering) is currently responsible for reviewing, merging and releasing new code.

We require that all contributors sign a [CLA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_PqkVpqgCL7psLuGCzZ6_OHbOS567E1JZ1hNMpfvZ-M/edit?usp=sharing) prior to making a contribution. Please download, sign and submit the CLA so we can accept your contributions. If you have questions, you can email mobile@kinvey.com.
